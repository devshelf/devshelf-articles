And in this part we’ll tackle with lexical environments implementation in exactly ECMAScript. In particular we’ll discuss structures and terminology used in ES to reflect this common theory.\r\n\r\nWe start from definitions. Though we already gave the definition of a lexical environment in the common theory, here we give it already relatively to the ECMA-262-5 standard.\r\n"

But as we know from the ES3 analysis, a property structure is more complex than just a string name. It also has set of attributes — those which we already discussed in ES3, e.g. {ReadOnly}, {DontEnum} and other. So from this viewpoint a property is as an object itself.\r\n\r\nFor full understanding of this chapter I recommend reading the Chaper 7.2. OOP: ECMAScript implementation of the ECMA-262-3 series."

In particular we’ll discuss structures and terminology used in ES to reflect this common theory.\r\n\r\nWe start from definitions.

But as we know from the ES3 analysis, a property structure is more complex than just a string name. It also has set of attributes — those which we already discussed in ES3, e.g. {ReadOnly}, {DontEnum} and other. So from this viewpoint a property is as an object itself.\r\n\r\nFor full understanding of this chapter I recommend reading the Chaper 7.2. OOP: ECMAScript implementation of the ECMA-262-3 series."
